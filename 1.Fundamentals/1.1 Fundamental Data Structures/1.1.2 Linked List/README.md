The second elementary data structure to consider is the linked list, which is defined as a primitive in some programming languages but not in C. However, C does provide basic operations that make it easy to use linked list.

The primary advantage of linked list over arrays is that linked list can grow and shrink during their lifetime. In particular, their maximum size not be known in advance.

The second advantage of linked list is that they provide flexibility in allowing the items to be rearranged efficiently.
