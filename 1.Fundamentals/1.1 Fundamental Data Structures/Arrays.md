# Arrays

Perhaps the most fundamental data structure is the **array**, which is defined as a primitive in C and most other programming languages.

Array
: is a fixed number of data items that are sotred contiguously and that are accesible by an index.

We refer to the *i*th element of an array *a* as *a[i]*.
